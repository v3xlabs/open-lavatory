## Wagmi Usage

`@openlv/connector` is designed to work seamlessly with [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh).

::::steps

### 1. Set up Wagmi

Get started with Wagmi by following the [official guide](https://wagmi.sh/react/getting-started).

### 2. Configure OpenLV

After you have setup Wagmi, you can set up OpenLV using the `openlv(){:ts}` connector.

```ts [wagmi.ts] twoslash
import { http, createConfig, createStorage } from 'wagmi'
import { mainnet } from 'wagmi/chains'
import { openlv } from '@openlv/connector' // [!code ++]

export const wagmiConfig = createConfig({
  chains: [mainnet],
  connectors: [openlv()], // [!code ++]
  transports: {
    [mainnet.id]: http(),
  },
})
```
