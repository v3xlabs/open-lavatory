## Getting Started

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
cd docs && pnpm dev
```

This will get you a build of all required packages, and load up a local development environment of the documentation site. The documentation site will be available at [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173), and contains a working example of the Modal via the [TryItOut](./docs/components/TryItOut.tsx) component.
