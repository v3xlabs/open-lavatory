# Theming

```ts [theme.ts] twoslash
// [!include ~/snippets/theme.ts]
```

## Custom Themes

You can pass your own theme token object to the connector.

```ts [theme-custom.ts] twoslash
// [!include ~/snippets/theme-custom.ts]
```

## Light & Dark mode

`mode` controls which variant the modal uses:

- `auto` (default): follows system preference and allows the user to adjust in the modal settings.
- `light`: forces light mode and hides theme selection in modal settings.
- `dark`: forces dark mode and hides theme selection in modal settings.

```ts [theme-mode.ts] twoslash
import { openlv } from "@openlv/connector";

openlv({
  theme: {
    theme: "simple", // or "openlv" or custom tokens
    mode: "auto", // "auto" | "light" | "dark"
  },
});
```
