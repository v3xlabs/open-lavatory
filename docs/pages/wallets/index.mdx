# Wallets

## Browser & Desktop

Web-based apps & Electron-based desktop apps can leverage the standard `@openlv/session` package.
Both as initiator and responder.

## Mobile

Currently openlv supports [react-native](/wallets/react-native).
You can read more about it in the [Mobile Wallets](/wallets/react-native) section.
Native implementations for android and ios are up for consideration.
