# Migrate from WalletConnect

So you are intrigued 🤔, lets get you started.

## dApp migration checklist

1. Add OpenLV connector:

```sh
pnpm install @openlv/connector wagmi
```

2. Include it in Wagmi config:

```ts
import { openlv } from '@openlv/connector'

connectors: [openlv()]
```

4. Keep other connectors, heck, even WalletConnect if you'd like.

5. Adjust the settings to your liking, see [configuration](/guides/configuration) for more details.

## Wallet-side migration checklist

1. Accept `openlv://...` URIs in your QR code or deep link flow.
2. Use `connectSession(uri, onMessage, webrtc())` to start a connection.
3. Implement EIP 1193-RPC request handling via`onMessage` just like you would expect.
4. Optionally store previous sessions, to allow for resumption at a later time.

## Important differences

- You won't need an API key.
- You don't need to agree to any aggressive licensing or terms of service.
- You won't need to run any infrastructure (tho you can).
- There are no rate-limits
