# Ntfy.sh

**ntfy** (pronounced *notify*) is a simple HTTP-based __pub-sub__ notification service.

```typescript
import { ntfy } from '@openlv/signaling/ntfy';

const session = await createSession({
    p: 'ntfy',
    s: 'https://ntfy.sh/'
}, ntfy);
```
## URL Format

```yaml
# Hosted ntfy.sh instance
https://ntfy.sh/
# Auth via token
https://mytoken1@ntfy.example.com/
# Auth via username and password
https://myuser:mypassword@ntfy.example.com/
# Any parameters are forwarded
https://ntfy.example.com/?auth=mytoken1
# Ntfy (http) & Ntfys (https) are supported
ntfy://mytoken1@ntfy.example.com/
ntfys://myuser:mypassword@ntfy.example.com/
```

## Hosted Infrastructure (ntfy.sh)

The official `ntfy.sh` instance is hosted by the ntfy team and is publicly available without authentication.
This means anyone can publish and subscribe to any topic.

## Self-Hosted

You can easily [self-host your own ntfy instance](https://docs.ntfy.sh/install/) with a variety of supported platforms.

Authentication is supported via token or username and password, this means you authenticate with your own instance should you so choose.
