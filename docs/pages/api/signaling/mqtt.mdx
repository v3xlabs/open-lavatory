# MQTT

MQTT is a lightweight publish/subscribe messaging protocol for connecting remote devices with minimal network bandwidth

```typescript
import { mqtt } from '@openlv/signaling/mqtt';

const session = await createSession({
    p: 'mqtt',
    s: 'wss://test.mosquitto.org:8081/mqtt'
}, mqtt);
```

## URL Format

```yaml
wss://test.mosquitto.org:8081/mqtt
```

## Hosted Infrastructure (test.mosquitto.org)

The `test.mosquitto.org` instance is hosted by the [Eclipse Foundation](https://www.eclipse.org/mosquitto/) as a publicly available MQTT broker with reasonable rate limits.

You can findout more about the Mosquitto MQTT broker [here](https://mosquitto.org/).

## Self-Hosted

You can host your own MQTT broker (either publicly or behind for example a private network), ensure to enable websockets with preference for SSL/TLS enabled.

This can easily be accomplished through the [eclipse/mosquitto](https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-mosquitto/) docker container.
