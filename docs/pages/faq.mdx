# FAQ

## What is Open Lavatory?

Open Lavatory is a secure peer-to-peer (with some extra steps) JSON-RPC that allows you to connect any dApp to your mobile or desktop wallet.

It is open, decentralized, and won't force you to migrate to a centralized _"version two"[*](https://walletconnect.mirror.xyz/vVOIJaXAl9o7H-b7ZSfKvfxyzxTqxjAgM6ha2Y32kAE)_

## Where is it hosted?

I dont know, that's up to you. OpenLV supports a variety of different [signaling protocols](/api/signaling) and [transport protocols](/api/transport).

This includes but is not limited to:
- [Public Infrastructure](/api/signaling/mqtt#public-infrastructure)
- [Your own infrastructure](/api/signaling/mqtt#self-hosted)
- Whatever the user decides

See [configuration](/guides/configuration) for defining your app defaults.

## Why doesn't my mobile wallet work with OpenLV (yet)?

Open Lavatory is brand new, you're reading about it right now!
We care about you, please contact your wallet developer and ask them to look into [implementing it](/wallets).

## How does OpenLV differ from WalletConnect?

| | OpenLV | WalletConnect (now Reown.. i guess) |
| -- | --------|---------------|
| Source Availability | Open Source | Closed Source |
| Privacy | E2EE, private by design | Tracks your every move (see [their website](https://reown.com/privacy-policy)) |
| Communication | P2P when possible | Central Relayer (relay.walletconnect.org) |
| Motivation | Public Good | Venture Capital |
| Usage in the wild | None, you're first | Has a monopoly (this is a problem) |

I'll leave it up to you to decide.
